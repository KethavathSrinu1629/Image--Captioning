# Image--Captioning
This project implements an image captioning system using deep learning techniques, specifically combining (CNNs) and (RNNs) with (LSTM) units. The goal is to generate descriptive textual captions for input images, leveraging the synergy between computer vision and natural language processing.
# Image Captioning using CNNs and LSTMs

*Last updated: June 16, 2023*

## Introduction

Image Captioning is the process of generating textual descriptions of images. This project combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to generate captions for images. It uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs) to perform image captioning.

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- tqdm
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
